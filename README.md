# Guild Manager 
## About
This application is being developed to help players to find guild's and also for guilds
to recruite players. Additionally I would like to add a calander feature to the guild
dashboard to create events like raid nights, m+ or pvp. I would also like for the application
to have a m+ 'team' that will be similar to a guild where people of the same IO score and 
item level can find a team to consistantly run m+ together using the calander feature.
I would also like to add a feature for planning cooldowns for boss fights by creating boss
abilities with timers and cooldown usage for each one. Lastly, I would like this planned
cooldown usage planner to generate a weak aura that would tell the raid when to use 
personals/warlock cookies along with healing cool downs and raid coordination.
